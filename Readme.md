## 🧠 Meet the Dream Team

Bringing **NewsWave** to life was a journey of collaboration, creativity, and clean code. Here's the squad that made it happen:

### 👑 Humza — *The Visionary (Team Leader)*
Humza led the project from concept to creation. From designing sleek UI mockups to managing tasks and reviewing code, he made sure the team stayed focused and the product stayed polished.

### 💻 Aman — *The Frontend Magician*
Aman turned designs into a living, breathing interface. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, he crafted the layout, news cards, and responsive views that make our app visually stunning.

### 🧩 Shehary — *The API Whisperer*
Shehary’s job? Make the app smart. He integrated the News API, handled async logic, and ensured that the latest news hits the screen instantly and securely.

### 🛡️ Farman — *The Debugger & Deployer*
Farman squashed bugs like a pro! He tested across devices, optimized performance, and handled the deployment pipeline so users get a smooth experience every time.
